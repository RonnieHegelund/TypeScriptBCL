TypeScriptBCL
=============

Base Class Library

Guid
Lists, queues, stacks, hashtables, dictionaries and readonly
StringBuilder

And what else that makes sense!

I know that I already can find most in JavaScript or TypeScript already, but I think i would be nice if there was only one place to get what you need, and a dedicated group to maintain the library. This would also be a good opportunity to meet others that would geek and talk about TypeScript!
